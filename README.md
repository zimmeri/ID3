# ID3
ID3 decision tree machine learning algorithm
Created a machine learning decision tree (ID3) to predict the outcome of passengers on the titanic, classifying by different attributes like gender, income, class. 
Utilized Vanilla, prune and max depth to examine varying parameters. 

Used titanic-train/titanic-train.data and titanic-train/titanic-train.label to train the algorithm
Used titanic-test/titanic-test.data and titanic-test/titanic-test.label to test the algorithm

ID3 algorithm is located in ID3.py

Was able to achieve maximum accuracy of 83.2%.  While these accuracies are not optimal, this was a 2 week project where 
I was unable to fine tune the algorithms.
